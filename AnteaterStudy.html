											<h3> What is Anteater?</h3>

                                                <p>Anteater is a debugging system that incorporates data visualization into the debugging process.
                                                It allows a user to choose variables and expressions that they wish to track throughout the execution of their Python program.
                                                Anteater instruments the program to record every instance of these variables and expressions, along with all function calls and loops.
                                                It then returns the trace file to a web page where the user can create data visualizations of the values collected in the trace. </p>

                                            <h3>Demo</h3>
                                            <p>Below is a demonstration of how someone might use Anteater on a simple gradient descent program that is not behaving correctly.
                                                Note, this video only highlights a subset of the capabilites of Anteater.

                                            <h3>Purpose of the Study</h3>
                                            <p> The purpose of this study is to validate the design of Anteater with real python users.
                                            We want to observe how real programmers use Anteater, learn what parts of Anteater they find helpful to the programming process,
                                            and understand how Anteater deviates from their expectations of a programming/debugging tool. </p>
                                             <br/>

                                            <h3>Your role as a participant</h3>
                                            <p>If you choose to participate you will be asked to attend two sessions with me. </p>
                                            <p>INnthe first session, you will be asked to bring a python program of your choosing.
                                            During the meeting, I will give you a more in depth introduction into Anteater.  We will then
                                            discuss your program and determine if it is a good fit for the study.  If it is, between the first
                                            and second sessions, I will create a set of tasks, specific to your program, for you to complete during the second session.</p>

                                            <p>In the second session, I will give you the tasks I have created for your porgram and ask you to complete them with Anteater.
                                            These tasks will be designed to guide your exploration with Anteater and hopefully help you gain insight into your program.
                                            After you have completed the tasks, you will be given time to use Anteater more if you desire to do so.  Once you have finished the tasks
                                            and free exploration, I will ask you some follow-up questions about your experiences using Anteater.</p>
                                             <br/>

                                             <h3>Compensation</h3>
                                            <p>
                                                Those of you who choose to participate will receive extra credit worth half of a homework assignment,equivalent to 2.5 percentage points on your overall grade.
                                                For those of you who do not wish to participate, there will an alternative extra credit opportunity that requires equal effort.
                                                You may also choose not to complete either extra credit assignment.
                                            </p>
                                             <br/>

                                            <h3>Confidentiality</h3>
                                            <p>To ensure confidentiality, I will be tracking students completion of the extra credit assignments.
                                            At the ned of the semetser, Dr. Scheidegger will know who has chosen to complete an extra credit assignment but will not know
                                            who chose to participate in the study and who chose to complete the alternative assignment. Participation in the study, or lack of participation, will
                                            have no bearing on your standing in Dr. Scheideggers course, aside from the extra credit points.</p>
                                             <br/>
