## Department Policies

#### Department of Computer Science Code of Conduct
The Department of Computer Science is committed to providing and maintaining a supportive educational environment for all.  We strive to be welcoming and inclusive, respect privacy and confidentiality, behave respectfully and courteously, and practice intellectual honesty.  Disruptive behaviors (such as physical or emotional harassment, dismissive attitudes, and abuse of department resources) will not be tolerated.  The complete Code of Conduct is available on our department web site.  We expect that you will adhere to this code, as well as the UA Student Code of Conduct, while you are a member of this class.

#### Classroom Behavior Policy
To foster a positive learning environment, students and instructors have a shared responsibility. We want a safe, welcoming, and inclusive environment where all of us feel comfortable with each other and where we can challenge ourselves to succeed. To that end, our focus is on the tasks at hand and not on extraneous activities (e.g., texting, chatting, reading a newspaper, making phone calls, web surfing, etc.).
Additional recommendations depending on instructor preferences: Students are asked to refrain from disruptive conversations with people sitting around them during lecture. Students observed engaging in disruptive activity will be asked to cease this behavior. Those who continue to disrupt the class will be asked to leave lecture or discussion and may be reported to the Dean of Students.
Alternate language for those who want to restrict computers and laptops to an area of the classroom: Some learning styles are best served by using personal electronics, such as laptops and iPads. These devices can be distracting to other learners. Therefore, students who prefer to use electronic devices for note-taking during lecture should use one side of the classroom.
Alternate recommended language for those who do not wish to permit laptops in the classroom: The use of personal electronics such as laptops, iPads, and other such mobile devices is distracting to the other students and the instructor. Their use can degrade the learning environment. Therefore, students are not permitted to use these devices during the class period.

#### Pronoun Preference
If you choose to, include your pronoun preferences and those of your TAs, if they are comfortable.

This course affirms people of all gender expressions and gender identities. If you prefer to be called a different name than what is on the class roster, please let me know. Feel free to correct instructors on your preferred gender pronoun. If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact me directly in class or via email (instructor email). If you wish to change your preferred name or pronoun in the UAccess system, please use the following guidelines:
Preferred name: University of Arizona students may choose to identify themselves within the University community using a preferred first name that differs from their official/legal name. A student’s preferred name will appear instead of the person’s official/legal first name in select University-related systems and documents, provided that the name is not being used for the purpose of misrepresentation. Students are able to update their preferred names in UAccess.
Pronouns: Students may designate pronouns they use to identify themselves. Instructors and staff are encouraged to use pronouns for people that they use for themselves as a sign of respect and inclusion. Students are able to update and edit their pronouns in UAccess.
More information on updating your preferred name and pronouns is available on the Office of the Registrar site at [https://www.registrar.arizona.edu/]().

#### Threatening Behavior Policy
The UA Threatening Behavior by Students Policy prohibits threats of physical harm to any member of the University community, including to oneself. See [http://policy.arizona.edu/education-and-student-affairs/threatening-behavior-students]().


#### Accessibility and Accommodations
The Disability Resources Offices provides guidelines regarding accessibility and accommodations:  [http://drc.arizona.edu/instructors/syllabus-statement]().

#### Code of Academic Integrity
Students are encouraged to share intellectual views and discuss freely the principles and applications of course materials. However, graded work/exercises must be the product of independent effort unless otherwise instructed. Students are expected to adhere to the UA Code of Academic Integrity as described in the UA General Catalog. See [http://deanofstudents.arizona.edu/academic-integrity/students/academic-integrity]().
Recommended language, if applicable: The University Libraries have some excellent tips for avoiding plagiarism, available at [http://new.library.arizona.edu/research/citing/plagiarism]().
Recommended language, if applicable: Selling class notes and/or other course materials to other students or to a third party for resale is not permitted without the instructor’s express written consent. Violations to this and other course rules are subject to the Code of Academic Integrity and may result in course sanctions. Additionally, students who use D2L or UA e-mail to sell or buy these copyrighted materials are subject to Code of Conduct Violations for misuse of student e-mail addresses. This conduct may also constitute copyright infringement.

#### UA Nondiscrimination and Anti-harassment Policy
The University is committed to creating and maintaining an environment free of discrimination; see [http://policy.arizona.edu/human-resources/nondiscrimination-and-anti-harassment-policy]()
Recommended language, if applicable: Our classroom is a place where everyone is encouraged to express well-formed opinions and their reasons for those opinions. We also want to create a tolerant and open environment where such opinions can be expressed without resorting to bullying or discrimination of others.

#### Additional Resources for Students

Student Assistance and Advocacy information is available at [http://deanofstudents.arizona.edu/student-assistance/students/student-assistance]()


+ Campus Pantry
Any student who has difficulty affording groceries or accessing sufficient food to eat every day, or who lacks a safe and stable place to live and believes this may affect their performance in the course, is urged to contact the Dean of Students for support. In addition, the University of Arizona Campus Pantry is open for students to receive supplemental groceries at no cost. Please see their website at: campuspantry.arizona.edu for open times.
Furthermore, please notify me if you are comfortable in doing so. This will enable me to provide any resources that I may possess.

+ Title IX

  The University of Arizona is committed to removing educational barriers created by sex discrimination and sexual harassment.  Sex discrimination under Title IX can include acts of violence based on sex, such as sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence, and stalking.  If you (or someone you know) has experienced or experiences any of these incidents, you have options for help at the University. The University of Arizona has staff members trained to support you in navigating campus life, accessing health and counseling services, providing academic and housing accommodations, helping with legal protective orders, and more.

  Please be aware that UA faculty and instructors who work with students are required to report allegations of sex discrimination to the Title IX Office.  This means that if you tell me about a situation involving sexual harassment, sexual assault, dating violence, domestic violence, or stalking that involves another student or employee, or that happens on campus or in a UA program, I must share that information with the Title IX Coordinator.  Although I have to make that notification, you will have choices regarding whether or not you want to pursue a formal complaint against anyone on campus. Our goal is to make sure you are aware of the range of options available to you and have access to the resources you need.
