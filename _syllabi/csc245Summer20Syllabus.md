#### Course Format and Teaching Methods
This class will be taught entirely online.  I will try to release all of the lecture videos for the week a the beginning of the week but I strongly recommend you pace yourself and watch them throughout the week.  Lectures will be posted on D2L, using Playposit to host the lectures and add question within the lectures.  Lectures will have a due date and completing the videos (and questions within the videos) by these dates will count towards your class participation grade.


<!-- Lecture only, lecture and lab combination, seminar, studio, small-group activities or group projects, experiential or service-learning, in-class discussion, web-delivered content or assessment, etc. -->

#### Course Objectives
+ **Course goal**: Students will learn the mathematical concepts and practices most useful for Computer Science.

+ **Course Objectives**:
  1. Learn and apply principles of logic to construct sound arguments.
  2. Learn several proof forms and construct complete proofs using those forms.
  3. Learn a variety of fundamental mathematical principles and apply them to solve problems relevant to the study of computer science.

#### Expected Learning Outcomes
 1. Reconstruct concept definitions and explain how more advanced concepts are defined in terms of more basic concepts.
 2. Given a set of hypotheses, determine whether or not a given conclusion logically follows from them.
 3. Given a non-trivial provable conjecture, construct a complete and logically sound proof that convincingly argues the truth of the conjecture.
 4. Demonstrate ability to convert between logic and set expressions.
 5. Solve specific types of recurrence relations and prove that the solutions define the same sequences as the original relations.
 6. Given a counting problem, produce the correct quantity of potential outcomes by identifying and applying the appropriate counting concepts.

<!-- Learning outcomes describe what a student should know or be able to do upon completing the course, based on knowledge/skills gained. Outcomes are stated in measurable terms and should be aligned with the learning outcomes for the program (e.g., Major, Minor, General Education).  3-4 outcomes are  sufficient.

#### Topic Schedule

Below is the planned schedule for the semester.  However, it is subject to change as the semester goes on.  A weekly schedule will be provided on the class webpage at he start of each week. Note, because the course is entirely online, I will do my best to release all of the lectures for the current week at the start of the week and they must all be completed by the end of the week. However, some weeks I may choose to release videos throughout the week rather than all at once.

<br/>

#### Participation (17% of final grade)
Because the course is online and asynchronous, I cannot give use standard measures for participation (attendance and participation in lecture sessions).  As such, participation will be measured through completion of lecture videos and quizzes.  
 + **Lecture Videos (5% of final grade)**
 Lecture videos can be found under "Content" on D2L.  They will be organized by week.  For the given week, all lecture videos must be completed by the end of the following weekend (i.e. for week 1 which starts on June 8th, videos must be completed by Sunday June 14th).  I will do my best to release lecture videos by the end of the Sunday of the current week but there may be weeks where I release some at the beginning, and the rest throughout the week. Completion of videos will be tracked through Playposit.  I will use Playposit to host the videos and insert questions into them.  Completion of these questions (and correctness of your answers), will determine your participation grade for that lecture. Note, these questions will not be designed to be difficult, but rather to keep students engaged and show that they actually watched the lectures.

 + **Quizzes (12% of final grade)**
 Starting in the second week, there will be a weekly quiz on Tuesdays, with the exception of exam weeks.  The quiz for a given week will be released Tuesday morning and must be submitted by Midnight that same Tuesday.  These quizzes are designed to give students an idea for the types of questions they will see on exams. I do not intend students to need to spend more than 10-15 minutes answering them.  Quiz questions will be on the material from the previous week. Quizzes will be worth 10 points and may be handwritten or typed (preferred).  They will be released on the course webpage and must be turned in through Gradescope.

#### Homework (48% of final grade)
Homework assignments designed to give you hands on experience with topics in preparation for the exams.  
 + *Frequency*: Beginning the first week of courses, students will be assigned a course 1 homework assignment per week. With 2 exceptions, homework assignments will be assigned on Friday and will be due the following Friday at **5 p.m.**. The two exceptions are: (1) the first week the homework will be assigned on the first day of classes Monday (6/8) but will still be due that Friday (6/12) and (2) in the fourth week of classes (6/29-7/3), Friday (7/3) is a holiday so the homework will instead by due on Thursday (7/2).  The week of exams, homework assignments will not be graded, they will solely be for practice on the topics of the prior week. However, I strongly recommend you at least attempt some of the problems on practice assignments as those topics will still be covered by exams.
 + *Content* With the exception of the first assignment, homework assignments will cover the material covered the week it is assigned.
 + *Submission*: Homework will be submitted on Gradescope.  
 + *Legibility*: A this time, I will not require you to type your homework.  However, I strongly encourage you to type your homework assignments, specifically with Latex.  Homework assignments that are not legible, may not be graded. I will offer 5%  extra credit per assignment for typed homework.   However, if legibility becomes too much of an issue, I will switch from offering 5% of extra credit to requiring typed homework for 5% in the grading rubric (meaning hand-written homework will get at most a 95%).  I strongly recommend learning Latex and using [Overleaf](https://overleaf.com) (it is free and easy to use).  To make this easier, I will provide Latex templates for each homework so you simply need to add your response below each question, along with a document of commonly used symbols for you to refer to.  
 + *Incomplete or Incorrect Homework*: On the due date, turn in what you have written for your assignment, whether it is complete or not.  Show your work! Partial credit can still be given for incomplete or incorrect answers/assignments if sufficient work is shown.  
 + *Scoring*: Typed homework will be awarded 5% extra credit. Feedback for individual assignments will be posted on Gradescope, along with the grading rubric used.
 + *Discussing Your Score*: If you do not understand why you lost points for a problem or want to hear feedback for improvement, feel free to come to us to discuss it.  I ask that you first meet with a TA (as they will be grading your homework) and come to that meeting with specific questions and concerns.  If after meeting with them, you are not satisfied, you can arrange a meeting with me to discuss your concerns. Note, that if you are looking to dispute your score, you must do so within a week of receiving your score and feedback. You may still ask questions about an assignment after a week but it will not result in a score change.
 + *Late Assignment Policy*: **No late assignments will be accepted**. Homework is do by **5 p.m.** on the specified due date.  Unless exceptional circumstances occur, homework will not be accepted after that time.



#### Midterm (15% of final grade)
There will be one midterm on July 9th.  It will be "take home" and as such will be open book but ***not*** open internet. It will be released on Thursday and must be completed by 5pm the following day. It will be written to take 60-90 minutes and will cover material up to the week prior. Note, it is intended to be closed internet so I ask that you not use the internet when completing it.  If we determine that you have used the internet, steep penalties will be applied (See the section on Academic Dishonesty).

+ *Regrade Requests* If you feel your exam was graded incorrectly, you may submit a request for me to regrade it within a week of receiving the graded exam.  In the request you must specify in detail what you think was misgraded.  However, when I receive a regrade request, I will regrade __**the entire exam**__.  This could lead to you getting a lower grade than you originally had if there were other grading errors in your favor so carefully look over your exam before submitting a regrade request.


#### Final Exam (20% of final grade)
The final will be on August 12.  It will be cumulative and cover all material from the course, with an emphasis on the last half. It will be hosted entirely on Gradescope. There will be an enforced time limit.  For each question, students will be asked to upload a pdf or image of their answer. This will inevitably add overhead to the time required to complete the exam so instead of the standard 2 hours that students are typically given to complete final exams, they will be given 4 hours.  The exam will still be written with the intent of taking 2 hours to complete.

**Subject to change notice**: I reserve the right to change the means by which I give you the final exam.  If after the midterm, there have been sufficiently few Academic Dishonesty cases, I will give the final as stated above.  However, if that is not the case, I may switch the format and require students to complete the exam in 2 hours using Examity.  I would prefer not to use Examity, but will do so if I believe that it is the only way to properly assess students knowledge of the course material.

## Course Policies
#### Academic Dishonesty
Students are encouraged to share intellectual views and discuss freely the principles and applications of course materials. However, graded work/exercises must be the product of independent effort unless otherwise instructed. It is not acceptable to 'borrow' solutions or part of solutions from other people or have other people write your homework.  Finding solutions on the internet is a violation of academic dishonesty!  You may, however, discuss assignment requirements and high-level concepts with other students (and are in fact encouraged to).  In addition, you may ask the TA's and myself questions about assignments but do not expect us to simply give you the answer. As a rule of thumb, if you wouldn't ask the question on piazza, you probably shouldn't be asking it to your classmate.


If we determine that a student or students violate this policy, all student's invovled will, at a **minimum**, receive no points for the assignment in question (including exams) and additionally will lose points equivalent to 50% of the assignment in question.  In other words, students will lose 150% on the assignment in question. Additional sanctions are possible depending on the circumstances of the offense(s) and the policies of the department, university, and Arizona Board of Regents, up to and including expulsion from the university.

Students are expected to adhere to the UA Code of Academic Integrity as described in the UA General Catalog. See [http://deanofstudents.arizona.edu/academic-integrity/students/academic-integrity](http://deanofstudents.arizona.edu/academic-integrity/students/academic-integrity). Please take the time to read this policy; ignorance of the policies is not an acceptable excuse for their violation.

Selling class notes and/or other course materials to other students or to a third party for resale is not permitted without the instructor’s express written consent. Violations to this and other course rules are subject to the Code of Academic Integrity and may result in course sanctions. Additionally, students who use D2L or UA e-mail to sell or buy these copyrighted materials are subject to Code of Conduct Violations for misuse of student e-mail addresses. This conduct may also constitute copyright infringement.


#### Absence and Class Participation Policy
Because the course is online, attendance and participation will be measured through students completing the lecture videos.  Lecture videos will be hosted on Playposit and will have questions interspersed to help keep students engaged.  Completion of these videos by the set deadline will count towards class participation/attendance.  Furthermore, there will be weekly quizzes (with the exception of the first week) that will also count towards participation.
<!-- Recommended: Be very specific about your absence policy and how you will handle exceptions. Encourage students to see an advisor if it is after the drop period (when a W will not appear on the transcript). Advisors will provide options and alternatives as appropriate for individual student situations. -->

The UA’s policy concerning Class Attendance, Participation, and Administrative Drops is available at [http://catalog.arizona.edu/policy/class-attendance-participation-and-administrative-drop](http://catalog.arizona.edu/policy/class-attendance-participation-and-administrative-drop)  
The UA policy regarding absences for any sincerely held religious belief, observance or practice will be accommodated where reasonable: [http://policy.arizona.edu/human-resources/religious-accommodation-policy](http://policy.arizona.edu/human-resources/religious-accommodation-policy).
Absences pre-approved by the UA Dean of Students (or dean’s designee) will be honored. See [https://deanofstudents.arizona.edu/absences](https://deanofstudents.arizona.edu/absences)

<!-- Participating in the course and attending lectures and other course events are vital to the learning process. As such, attendance is required at all lectures and discussion section meetings. Absences may affect a student’s final course grade. If you anticipate being absent, are unexpectedly absent, or are unable to participate in class online activities, please contact me as soon as possible.  To request a disability-related accommodation to this attendance policy, please contact the Disability Resource Center at (520) 621-3268 or drc-info@email.arizona.edu. If you are experiencing unexpected barriers to your success in your courses, the Dean of Students Office is a central support resource for all students and may be helpful. The Dean of Students Office is located in the Robert L. Nugent Building, room 100, or call 520-621-7057. -->

#### Makeup Policy for Students Who Register Late
Students who register after the first class meeting may make up missed assignments at a deadline set in consultation with the instructor.

#### Course Communications
We will primarily communicate through email ([rjfaust@email.arizona.edu](mailto:rjfaust@email.arizona.edu)) and [Piazza](https://piazza.com/home/summer2020/csc245/home).

[D2L](https://d2l.arizona.edu/d2l/home/899542) will be used for posting lectures and grades.

[Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/124297) will be used for homework submissions, quizzes, and exams.

<!-- Means by which online communication will be conducted (e.g., official UA e-mail address, D2L, Piazza) -->


#### Grading Scale and Policies
- Grades will be assigned on the following scale:
  + A>=90%
  + 80%<=B<90%
  + 70%<=C<80%

<!-- Specify the grade distribution for the course. University policy regarding grades and grading systems is available at [http://catalog.arizona.edu/policy/grades-and-grading-system]()
Provide a detailed explanation of the methods of evaluation and how the final grade will be calculated, including components/assignments, weightings, evaluation criteria, explanation of how late work will be graded, and description of extra-credit opportunities.
Department of Computer Science Grading Policy:
Instructors will explicitly promise when every assignment and exam will be graded and returned to students.  These promised dates will appear in the syllabus, associated with the corresponding due dates and exam dates.
Graded homework will be returned before the next homework is due.
Exams will be returned "promptly", as defined by the instructor (and as promised in the syllabus).
Grading delays beyond promised return-by dates will be announced as soon as possible with an explanation for the delay.
If the course is a 400/500: Include a grading scale (as per above) that is specific to graduate students. Also include a description of how the experiences of undergraduate and graduate students will be differentiated in addition to information on how this requirement/experience figures in the grading scheme. -->


#### Response Time
As per department policy, graded homework assignments will be returned before the next homework is due (thus within a week of the due date).  Likewise, quizzes will be returned within a week of their due date as well.  We will do our best to return and review the graded midterm by midweek of the week following the exam.  

The instructor and TA's will attempt to reply to all emails and piazza posts within 24 hours of receiving them (48 on weekends and holidays). If you submit a question less than hours before an assignment is due, you risk not getting an answer before the deadline.

#### Requests for incomplete (I) or withdrawal (W)
Requests must be made in accordance with University policies, which are available at [http://catalog.arizona.edu/policy/grades-and-grading-system#incomplete](http://catalog.arizona.edu/policy/grades-and-grading-system#incomplete) and [http://catalog.arizona.edu/policy/grades-and-grading-system#Withdrawal](http://catalog.arizona.edu/policy/grades-and-grading-system#Withdrawal), respectively.


#### Dispute of Grade Policy
All grades you wish to dispute must be done within a week of receiving the graded assignment.  For homework and quizzes, first set up a meeting with a TA to discuss it.  If you are not satisfied with their response, you can then set up a meeting with me to discuss your assignment.  For the midterm, as stated previously, if you feel your exam was graded incorrectly, you may submit a request for me to regrade it within a week of receiving the graded exam.  In the request you must specify in detail what you think was misgraded.  However, when I receive a regrade request, I will regrade __**the entire exam**__.  This could lead to you getting a lower grade than you originally had if there were other grading errors in your favor so carefully look over your exam before submitting a regrade request.

## Department and University Policies

#### Department of Computer Science Code of Conduct
The Department of Computer Science is committed to providing and maintaining a supportive educational environment for all.  We strive to be welcoming and inclusive, respect privacy and confidentiality, behave respectfully and courteously, and practice intellectual honesty.  Disruptive behaviors (such as physical or emotional harassment, dismissive attitudes, and abuse of department resources) will not be tolerated.  The complete Code of Conduct is available on our department web site.  We expect that you will adhere to this code, as well as the UA Student Code of Conduct, while you are a member of this class.

#### Classroom Behavior Policy
To foster a positive learning environment, students and instructors have a shared responsibility. We want a safe, welcoming, and inclusive environment where all of us feel comfortable with each other and where we can challenge ourselves to succeed. To that end, our focus is on the tasks at hand and not on extraneous activities (e.g., texting, chatting, reading a newspaper, making phone calls, web surfing, etc.).
<!-- Additional recommendations depending on instructor preferences: Students are asked to refrain from disruptive conversations with people sitting around them during lecture. Students observed engaging in disruptive activity will be asked to cease this behavior. Those who continue to disrupt the class will be asked to leave lecture or discussion and may be reported to the Dean of Students.
Alternate language for those who want to restrict computers and laptops to an area of the classroom: Some learning styles are best served by using personal electronics, such as laptops and iPads. These devices can be distracting to other learners. Therefore, students who prefer to use electronic devices for note-taking during lecture should use one side of the classroom.
Alternate recommended language for those who do not wish to permit laptops in the classroom: The use of personal electronics such as laptops, iPads, and other such mobile devices is distracting to the other students and the instructor. Their use can degrade the learning environment. Therefore, students are not permitted to use these devices during the class period. -->

#### Pronoun Preference
This course affirms people of all gender expressions and gender identities. If you prefer to be called a different name than what is on the class roster, please let me know. Feel free to correct instructors on your preferred gender pronoun. If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact me directly in class or via email (instructor email). If you wish to change your preferred name or pronoun in the UAccess system, please use the following guidelines:
Preferred name: University of Arizona students may choose to identify themselves within the University community using a preferred first name that differs from their official/legal name. A student’s preferred name will appear instead of the person’s official/legal first name in select University-related systems and documents, provided that the name is not being used for the purpose of misrepresentation. Students are able to update their preferred names in UAccess.
Pronouns: Students may designate pronouns they use to identify themselves. Instructors and staff are encouraged to use pronouns for people that they use for themselves as a sign of respect and inclusion. Students are able to update and edit their pronouns in UAccess.
More information on updating your preferred name and pronouns is available on the Office of the Registrar site at [https://www.registrar.arizona.edu/](https://www.registrar.arizona.edu/).

#### Threatening Behavior Policy
The UA Threatening Behavior by Students Policy prohibits threats of physical harm to any member of the University community, including to oneself. See [http://policy.arizona.edu/education-and-student-affairs/threatening-behavior-students](http://policy.arizona.edu/education-and-student-affairs/threatening-behavior-students).


#### Accessibility and Accommodations
The Disability Resources Offices provides guidelines regarding accessibility and accommodations:  [http://drc.arizona.edu/instructors/syllabus-statement](http://drc.arizona.edu/instructors/syllabus-statement).



#### UA Nondiscrimination and Anti-harassment Policy
The University is committed to creating and maintaining an environment free of discrimination; see [http://policy.arizona.edu/human-resources/nondiscrimination-and-anti-harassment-policy](http://policy.arizona.edu/human-resources/nondiscrimination-and-anti-harassment-policy)
<!-- Recommended language, if applicable: Our classroom is a place where everyone is encouraged to express well-formed opinions and their reasons for those opinions. We also want to create a tolerant and open environment where such opinions can be expressed without resorting to bullying or discrimination of others. -->

#### Additional Resources for Students

+ **Campus Pantry**:
Any student who has difficulty affording groceries or accessing sufficient food to eat every day, or who lacks a safe and stable place to live and believes this may affect their performance in the course, is urged to contact the Dean of Students for support. In addition, the University of Arizona Campus Pantry is open for students to receive supplemental groceries at no cost. Please see their website at: campuspantry.arizona.edu for open times.
Furthermore, please notify me if you are comfortable in doing so. This will enable me to provide any resources that I may possess.

+ **Title IX**:
  The University of Arizona is committed to removing educational barriers created by sex discrimination and sexual harassment.  Sex discrimination under Title IX can include acts of violence based on sex, such as sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence, and stalking.  If you (or someone you know) has experienced or experiences any of these incidents, you have options for help at the University. The University of Arizona has staff members trained to support you in navigating campus life, accessing health and counseling services, providing academic and housing accommodations, helping with legal protective orders, and more.

  Please be aware that UA faculty and instructors who work with students are required to report allegations of sex discrimination to the Title IX Office.  This means that if you tell me about a situation involving sexual harassment, sexual assault, dating violence, domestic violence, or stalking that involves another student or employee, or that happens on campus or in a UA program, I must share that information with the Title IX Coordinator.  Although I have to make that notification, you will have choices regarding whether or not you want to pursue a formal complaint against anyone on campus. Our goal is to make sure you are aware of the range of options available to you and have access to the resources you need.
