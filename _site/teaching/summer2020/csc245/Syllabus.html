<h4 id="course-format-and-teaching-methods">Course Format and Teaching Methods</h4>
<p>This class will be taught entirely online.  I will try to release all of the lecture videos for the week a the beginning of the week but I strongly recommend you pace yourself and watch them throughout the week.  Lectures will have a due date and completing the videos by these dates will count towards your class participation grade.</p>

<p>Lecture only, lecture and lab combination, seminar, studio, small-group activities or group projects, experiential or service-learning, in-class discussion, web-delivered content or assessment, etc.</p>

<h4 id="course-objectives">Course Objectives</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Course goal</strong>: Students will learn the mathematical concepts and practices most useful for Computer Science.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Course Objectives</strong>:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Learn and apply principles of logic to construct sound arguments.</li>
      <li>Learn several proof forms and construct complete proofs using those forms.</li>
      <li>Learn a variety of fundamental mathematical principles and apply them to solve problems relevant to the study of computer science.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="expected-learning-outcomes">Expected Learning Outcomes</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Reconstruct concept definitions and explain how more advanced concepts are defined in terms of more basic concepts.</li>
  <li>Given a set of hypotheses, determine whether or not a given conclusion logically follows from them.</li>
  <li>Given a non-trivial provable conjecture, construct a complete and logically sound proof that convincingly argues the truth of the conjecture.</li>
  <li>Demonstrate ability to convert between logic and set expressions.</li>
  <li>Solve specific types of recurrence relations and prove that the solutions define the same sequences as the original relations.</li>
  <li>Given a counting problem, produce the correct quantity of potential outcomes by identifying and applying the appropriate counting concepts.</li>
</ol>

<!-- Learning outcomes describe what a student should know or be able to do upon completing the course, based on knowledge/skills gained. Outcomes are stated in measurable terms and should be aligned with the learning outcomes for the program (e.g., Major, Minor, General Education).  3-4 outcomes are  sufficient.

<h2 id="course-policies">Course Policies</h2>
<h4 id="absence-and-class-participation-policy">Absence and Class Participation Policy</h4>
<p>Because the course is online, attendance and participation will be measured through students completing the lecture videos.  Lecture videos will be hosted on Playposit and will have questions interspersed to help keep students engaged.  Completion of these videos by the set deadline will count towards class participation/attendance.  Furthermore, there will be weekly quizzes (with the exception of the first week) that will also count towards participation.
<!-- Recommended: Be very specific about your absence policy and how you will handle exceptions. Encourage students to see an advisor if it is after the drop period (when a W will not appear on the transcript). Advisors will provide options and alternatives as appropriate for individual student situations. --></p>

<p>The UA’s policy concerning Class Attendance, Participation, and Administrative Drops is available at <a href="">http://catalog.arizona.edu/policy/class-attendance-participation-and-administrative-drop</a><br />
The UA policy regarding absences for any sincerely held religious belief, observance or practice will be accommodated where reasonable: <a href="">http://policy.arizona.edu/human-resources/religious-accommodation-policy</a>.
Absences pre-approved by the UA Dean of Students (or dean’s designee) will be honored. See <a href="">https://deanofstudents.arizona.edu/absences</a></p>

<p>Participating in the course and attending lectures and other course events are vital to the learning process. As such, attendance is required at all lectures and discussion section meetings. Absences may affect a student’s final course grade. If you anticipate being absent, are unexpectedly absent, or are unable to participate in class online activities, please contact me as soon as possible.  To request a disability-related accommodation to this attendance policy, please contact the Disability Resource Center at (520) 621-3268 or drc-info@email.arizona.edu. If you are experiencing unexpected barriers to your success in your courses, the Dean of Students Office is a central support resource for all students and may be helpful. The Dean of Students Office is located in the Robert L. Nugent Building, room 100, or call 520-621-7057.</p>

<h4 id="makeup-policy-for-students-who-register-late">Makeup Policy for Students Who Register Late</h4>
<p>Students who register after the first class meeting may make up missed assignments at a deadline set in consultation with the instructor.</p>

<h4 id="course-communications">Course Communications</h4>
<p>We will primarily communicate through email (<a href="mailto:rjfaust@email.arizona.edu">rjfaust@email.arizona.edu</a>) and <a href="https://piazza.com/home/summer2020/csc245/home">Piazza</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://d2l.arizona.edu/d2l/home/899542">D2L</a> will be used for posting lectures and grades.</p>

<h4 id="topic-schedule">Topic Schedule</h4>

<p>Below is the planned schedule for the semester.  However, it is subject to change as the semester goes on.  A weekly schedule will be provided on the class webpage at he start of each week. Note, because the course is entirely online, I will do my best to release all of the lectures for the current week at the start of the week and they must all be completed by the end of the week. However, some weeks I may choose to release videos throughout the week rather than all at once.</p>

<h2 id="department-policies">Department Policies</h2>

<h4 id="department-of-computer-science-code-of-conduct">Department of Computer Science Code of Conduct</h4>
<p>The Department of Computer Science is committed to providing and maintaining a supportive educational environment for all.  We strive to be welcoming and inclusive, respect privacy and confidentiality, behave respectfully and courteously, and practice intellectual honesty.  Disruptive behaviors (such as physical or emotional harassment, dismissive attitudes, and abuse of department resources) will not be tolerated.  The complete Code of Conduct is available on our department web site.  We expect that you will adhere to this code, as well as the UA Student Code of Conduct, while you are a member of this class.</p>

<h4 id="classroom-behavior-policy">Classroom Behavior Policy</h4>
<p>To foster a positive learning environment, students and instructors have a shared responsibility. We want a safe, welcoming, and inclusive environment where all of us feel comfortable with each other and where we can challenge ourselves to succeed. To that end, our focus is on the tasks at hand and not on extraneous activities (e.g., texting, chatting, reading a newspaper, making phone calls, web surfing, etc.).
Additional recommendations depending on instructor preferences: Students are asked to refrain from disruptive conversations with people sitting around them during lecture. Students observed engaging in disruptive activity will be asked to cease this behavior. Those who continue to disrupt the class will be asked to leave lecture or discussion and may be reported to the Dean of Students.
Alternate language for those who want to restrict computers and laptops to an area of the classroom: Some learning styles are best served by using personal electronics, such as laptops and iPads. These devices can be distracting to other learners. Therefore, students who prefer to use electronic devices for note-taking during lecture should use one side of the classroom.
Alternate recommended language for those who do not wish to permit laptops in the classroom: The use of personal electronics such as laptops, iPads, and other such mobile devices is distracting to the other students and the instructor. Their use can degrade the learning environment. Therefore, students are not permitted to use these devices during the class period.</p>

<h4 id="pronoun-preference">Pronoun Preference</h4>
<p>This course affirms people of all gender expressions and gender identities. If you prefer to be called a different name than what is on the class roster, please let me know. Feel free to correct instructors on your preferred gender pronoun. If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact me directly in class or via email (instructor email). If you wish to change your preferred name or pronoun in the UAccess system, please use the following guidelines:
Preferred name: University of Arizona students may choose to identify themselves within the University community using a preferred first name that differs from their official/legal name. A student’s preferred name will appear instead of the person’s official/legal first name in select University-related systems and documents, provided that the name is not being used for the purpose of misrepresentation. Students are able to update their preferred names in UAccess.
Pronouns: Students may designate pronouns they use to identify themselves. Instructors and staff are encouraged to use pronouns for people that they use for themselves as a sign of respect and inclusion. Students are able to update and edit their pronouns in UAccess.
More information on updating your preferred name and pronouns is available on the Office of the Registrar site at <a href="">https://www.registrar.arizona.edu/</a>.</p>

<h4 id="threatening-behavior-policy">Threatening Behavior Policy</h4>
<p>The UA Threatening Behavior by Students Policy prohibits threats of physical harm to any member of the University community, including to oneself. See <a href="">http://policy.arizona.edu/education-and-student-affairs/threatening-behavior-students</a>.</p>

<h4 id="accessibility-and-accommodations">Accessibility and Accommodations</h4>
<p>The Disability Resources Offices provides guidelines regarding accessibility and accommodations:  <a href="">http://drc.arizona.edu/instructors/syllabus-statement</a>.</p>

<h4 id="code-of-academic-integrity">Code of Academic Integrity</h4>
<p>Students are encouraged to share intellectual views and discuss freely the principles and applications of course materials. However, graded work/exercises must be the product of independent effort unless otherwise instructed. Students are expected to adhere to the UA Code of Academic Integrity as described in the UA General Catalog. See <a href="">http://deanofstudents.arizona.edu/academic-integrity/students/academic-integrity</a>.
Recommended language, if applicable: The University Libraries have some excellent tips for avoiding plagiarism, available at <a href="">http://new.library.arizona.edu/research/citing/plagiarism</a>.
Recommended language, if applicable: Selling class notes and/or other course materials to other students or to a third party for resale is not permitted without the instructor’s express written consent. Violations to this and other course rules are subject to the Code of Academic Integrity and may result in course sanctions. Additionally, students who use D2L or UA e-mail to sell or buy these copyrighted materials are subject to Code of Conduct Violations for misuse of student e-mail addresses. This conduct may also constitute copyright infringement.</p>

<h4 id="ua-nondiscrimination-and-anti-harassment-policy">UA Nondiscrimination and Anti-harassment Policy</h4>
<p>The University is committed to creating and maintaining an environment free of discrimination; see <a href="">http://policy.arizona.edu/human-resources/nondiscrimination-and-anti-harassment-policy</a>
Recommended language, if applicable: Our classroom is a place where everyone is encouraged to express well-formed opinions and their reasons for those opinions. We also want to create a tolerant and open environment where such opinions can be expressed without resorting to bullying or discrimination of others.</p>

<h4 id="additional-resources-for-students">Additional Resources for Students</h4>

  <li>
    <p>Campus Pantry
Any student who has difficulty affording groceries or accessing sufficient food to eat every day, or who lacks a safe and stable place to live and believes this may affect their performance in the course, is urged to contact the Dean of Students for support. In addition, the University of Arizona Campus Pantry is open for students to receive supplemental groceries at no cost. Please see their website at: campuspantry.arizona.edu for open times.
Furthermore, please notify me if you are comfortable in doing so. This will enable me to provide any resources that I may possess.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Title IX</p>

    <p>The University of Arizona is committed to removing educational barriers created by sex discrimination and sexual harassment.  Sex discrimination under Title IX can include acts of violence based on sex, such as sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence, and stalking.  If you (or someone you know) has experienced or experiences any of these incidents, you have options for help at the University. The University of Arizona has staff members trained to support you in navigating campus life, accessing health and counseling services, providing academic and housing accommodations, helping with legal protective orders, and more.</p>

    <p>Please be aware that UA faculty and instructors who work with students are required to report allegations of sex discrimination to the Title IX Office.  This means that if you tell me about a situation involving sexual harassment, sexual assault, dating violence, domestic violence, or stalking that involves another student or employee, or that happens on campus or in a UA program, I must share that information with the Title IX Coordinator.  Although I have to make that notification, you will have choices regarding whether or not you want to pursue a formal complaint against anyone on campus. Our goal is to make sure you are aware of the range of options available to you and have access to the resources you need.</p>
